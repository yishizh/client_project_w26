        <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is a crucial component of a successful job search. 
                Building and maintaining professional relationships can open doors to opportunities 
                that may not be advertised publicly. Here are some strategies to enhance 
                your networking efforts:
            1. Attend Industry Events: Participate in conferences, workshops, and seminars related to your field.
            2. Leverage Social Media: Use platforms like LinkedIn to connect with professionals and join relevant groups.
            3. Informational Interviews: Reach out to individuals in roles or companies you’re interested in to learn more about their experiences.
            4. Alumni Networks: Connect with UMSI alumni who can provide insights and potential job leads.
            5. Follow Up: After meeting someone, send a thank-you note or email to express your appreciation and keep the conversation going

            <h2>How to initiate</h2>
            <p>
                Initiating networking conversations can be intimidating, but with the right approach, 
                it can lead to meaningful connections. Start by researching the person or organization you want to 
                connect with. Prepare thoughtful questions and topics to discuss. Be genuine and show interest 
                in their work. Remember, networking is about building relationships, not just asking for favors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some conversation starters:
                1. "I noticed you work in [industry/role]. Can you tell me more about your experience?"
                2. "What advice would you give to someone looking to enter this field?"
                3. "Are there any upcoming events or groups you recommend for networking in this area?"
                4. "How did you get started in your career?"
                5. "What skills do you think are most important for success in this industry?"
